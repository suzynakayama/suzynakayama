##### 👋 Hi! I am Suzy Nakayama 😊

Right now:

- 💻 I am working on Code Mentoring Toronto (international community that provides mentoring, coaching and a welcoming platform for developers of all levels to improve their skills. We are creating the “duolingo” (learning platform) for coding) with these techs: NestJs, ReactJs, Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo, Styled Components, Lerna and Figma.

- 🤓 I am learning GraphQL/Apollo and Flask.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a lawyer and a pastry chef before discovering how cool it is to code! Also, I like to crochet and watch animes!
